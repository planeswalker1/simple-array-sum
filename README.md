## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about arrays completed in JavaScript._

## challenge

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.

For example, if the array <em>ar = [1, 2, 3], 1 + 2 + 3 = 6</em>, so return 6.

<strong>Function Description</strong>

Make a function that returns the sum of the array elements as an integer.

This function has the following parameter(s):

*ar: an array of integers

<strong>Input Format</strong>

The first line contains an integer, <em>n</em>, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains <em>n</em> space-separated integers representing the array's elements.

<strong>Constraints</strong>

0 < <em>n, ar[i]</em> <= 1000

<strong>Output Format</strong>

Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.

<strong>Sample Input</strong>

```
6
1 2 3 4 10 11
```

<strong>Sample Output</strong>

```
31
```

<strong>Explanation</strong>

We print the sum of the array's elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31.
